# Correlation and Regression Lines

The two regression lines of a bivariate distribution are:

4x – 5y + 33 = 0 (line of y on x) 20x – 9y – 107 = 0 (line of x on y).



Estimate the value of x when y = 7. Compute the correct answer to one decimal place.

### Output Format
Push the answer to your github repo. It will be a floating point/decimal value. Your answer may look like: 7.2

This is NOT the actual answer - just the format in which you should provide your answer.


### Answer:

  * This question is ill-formed or either an attempt to confuse gone wrong.

  * At y=7 solving the two equations will give y_on_x x =1/2, x_on_y x = 8.5 .
  * Question says it is a [bivariate distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_probability_distribution)
  * In which case, two equations really are not the same x, but x1 and x2.
  * So what does it mean to estimate the value of x???
  * Does it mean calculate both x1 and x2??
  * Ugghhh..

  * Only alternate conclusion is that they have a different interpretation of bivariate distribution.
  * Let's assume some other things like, there's only one x and one y, but they have two linear regression lines at different ranges.
  * That raises the question what are these ranges?
  * And still, what does it mean to calculate one value of x?

  * Any other interpretation of bivariate distribution where it makes sense to calculate one value of x is beyond my imagination. Let me know if it is in yours.
